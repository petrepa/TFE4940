    abstract = "Despite the word's common usage by gamers and reviewers alike, it is still not clear what immersion means. This paper explores immersion further by investigating whether immersion can be defined quantitatively, describing three experiments in total. The first experiment investigated participants’ abilities to switch from an immersive to a non-immersive task. The second experiment investigated whether there were changes in participants’ eye movements during an immersive task. The third experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state anxiety, positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings suggest that immersion can be measured subjectively (through questionnaires) as well as objectively (task completion time, eye movements). Furthermore, immersion is not only viewed as a positive experience: negative emotions and uneasiness (i.e. anxiety) also run high."

abstract="We consider the problem of learning deep neural networks (DNNs) for object category segmentation, where the goal is to label each pixel in an image as being part of a given object (foreground) or not (background). Deep neural networks are usually trained with simple loss functions (e.g., softmax loss). These loss functions are appropriate for standard classification problems where the performance is measured by the overall classification accuracy. For object category segmentation, the two classes (foreground and background) are very imbalanced. The intersection-over-union (IoU) is usually used to measure the performance of any object category segmentation method. In this paper, we propose an approach for directly optimizing this IoU measure in deep neural networks. Our experimental results on two object category segmentation datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms DNNs trained with standard softmax loss.",
